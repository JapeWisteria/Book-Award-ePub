<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This is a book of lists. A lot of lists. The chrysalis for this came from a post I did on my blog in 2009 titled "The Cost of a Classical Education", in which I compared a number of well-known "classics" imprints and compared what it would cost to buy the entire series, and what you would get out of it. At the time, Penguin Classics was the most expensive, with Dover Thrift being the least, and buying them all would cost just over $57,000.</p>

<p>I then started to look at other lists for books, primarily awards. And I started the grueling process of taking the (thousands!) of international literary awards and trying to combine them into some kind of order. I was very quickly mired in too much information, and decided to leave it till I had a clearer idea of what I wanted.</p>

<p>At this time, I was also reading vintage science fiction, fantasy, and pulps, loving the covers (often lurid), and comparing the attitudes of the day to current trends in those genres. I was also surprised to learn how often authors crossed genre lines, and wrote mysteries, noir detective fiction, pulps and horror.</p>

<p>Now I knew what I wanted to do. And this small book is the result.</p>

<h2>What's listed here and why</h2>

<p>There are 33 distinct awards listed here, with the first award handed out in 1918, and tracked to 2010. These awards cover the genres of literature, science fiction, fantasy, horror, mystery, young adult and children's literature. They are for novels only (in the case of children's books, this means complete stories, not anthologies), and only for best-in-class. There is the occasional award for comics and illustrated stories, but I've kept that to a minimum.</p>

<p>I've chosen the 33 awards in a rather arbitrary fashion. Some of the main criteria include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>English language only (this includes translations).</li>
	<li>American, British and Commonwealth awards.</li>
	<li>For literature, I've stuck to only a few major awards (Pulitzer, Booker, National Book Award)</li>
	<li>I'm Canadian, and I want this collection to have a regional focus. There are many distinctly Canadian awards on the list.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many of these awards have dozens of categories, many of them changing as the award evolved. This is why I've focused entirely on novels, and not short stories, anthologies, novellas, and many of the other awards an organization might offer every year. Choosing novels meant that a consolidated list like the one I'm presenting here was the closest "apples to apples" comparison you could make, although it still isn't perfect.</p>

<p>The awards end at 2010 because that's the year I started looking at this, and I decided that was a good place to quit...at least for now. If there's any interest in this going forward, I may update it. Some awards are also awarded for the previous year (ie the award will be handed out in 2016 for a 2015 award), so any list of this sort will always trail by a year regardless.</p>

<p>The awards are heavily weighted towards science fiction, fantasy, mystery and children's books, with horror and literature only lightly represented. This was a clearly arbitrary choice, as I love these genres, and wanted to represent them in their best light.</p>

<h2>How it's organized</h2>
<p>I felt it was pointless to have 33 individual lists, 1 for each award, so I've combined the results into 2 large lists, 1 chronological, and 1 by author. I've created a separate author's list that only has children's books, specifically for parents who might want to use this as a resource with their children.</p>

<p>There is another section that lists some general statistics, and then has lists for both the authors and books with the most wins. These statistics are arbitrary, given the decisions I've already made in what awards to cover, but give a general idea of popular winners.</p>

<p>The last section lists some general resources, including a list of Nobel Laureates, several well-known fantasy series, and some links to other resources on the web.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>The section describing the awards has a lot of text from Wikipedia, which I've edited for length. According to Wikipedia's attribution section, this should be ok. I'll gladly remove it if it isn't.</p>

<h2>Thank you for reading</h2>
<p>I hope the book has some value for you. I enjoyed the process of putting it together, even if it took far too long to complete. If you found this book via the blog post, leave a comment! I'd love to hear your thoughts.</p>
